# Spotify music market overview in Excel

Is organic growth dead? A new artist's journey to stardom needs a data strategy. For my latest project, I analyzed Spotify data to reverse-engineer the success of the platform's biggest stars—from Taylor Swift to BTS.

## The Core Business Problem: 
How can a new artist maximize their chances of breaking through?

## Project Scope & Data: 
My analysis was built on a robust Spotify dataset containing over 8,500 rows of data, covering key features like: artist_name, artist_genres, artist_followers_count, album_release_date


### Key Insights from the Analysis:
- Content Volume is Key: I found a 63% correlation between an artist's total followers and the number of tracks they have issued. Consistency and volume are the primary drivers of long-term audience growth.

- Genre Dominance: My analysis of the top 10 genres (see chart) shows massive growth potential in Country and Pop, but also specific niches like Soundtrack and Alt. Pop.

- Market Saturation: The number of tracks released on Spotify has been steadily accelerating since 2021 (see trend chart). Breaking through now requires an even more focused strategy than ever before.
